# Tic Tac Toe repo
This is the code I've created to play the Tic Tac Toe game.
I've tried to catch all the errors possible during the game.

## How to use it
You should use python3:
```
python3 tic_tac_toe_interactive.py
```
Then, you'll be asked the players' names.

## Requirements
```
numpy==1.24.3
matplotlib==3.7.2
```
